# Odin Recipes

Odin's Recipes is a community-driven food brand providing trusted resources to home cooks. Cooks who are feeling adventurous and ready to cook up a storm.

Since Odin gives all the food on his table to his wolves, he requires no food. Wine to him is both meat and a drink!

## What the project is about

- Demonstrating HTML skills only.
- Documenting as I build this website.
- It won't be so pretty.
- It will have an index.html page and recipes pages.
- Learning Git workflow basics.

## Desired Outcomes

People can browse through recipes on the fly.
